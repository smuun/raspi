See the top level README file for more information on documentation
and how to run these programs.

Derived from a microcontroller i2c version derived from a spi raspiberry
pi version.

If you search for ssd1306 at adafruit or micro oled atsparkfun you will
find similar displays.

On ebay though there are gobzillions, search for I2C serial oled this is
a 128x64.  I paid under $4 shipping included each.

Looking at the top if the raspberry pi oriented with the two rows of
pins on your right, the top right pin of those is pin number 2, the
one below that on the outside is pin 4, 6, 8, and so on.  Where the
uart TX and RX are.

The left side is pin 1,3,5,7 and so on.  We are using those:

//inner corner
// 1 3.3v
// 3 GPIO2 SDA
// 5 GPIO3 SCL
// 7 GPOI4 (not used here)
// 9 Ground

// vcc gnd scl sda

Connect the display to the pi like this

OLED  PI
------------
VCC   PIN 1
GND   PIN 9
SCL   PIN 3
SDA   PIN 2

You can google SSD1306 to find a datasheet.
