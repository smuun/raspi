See the top level README file for more information on documentation
and how to run these programs.

I didnt realize that the swd information has been documented in the
stm32 and other places for a while now.  Despite that I am only
getting so far, can read the DP id register, but cannot turn on the
debugger to read the ap id register.  or even read back the stat
after writing control.   WIP.
