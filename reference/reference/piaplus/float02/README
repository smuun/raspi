See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi A+, see other directories for other flavors
of raspberry pi.

Just having some fun.  Curious to know how the hardware fpu compared
to TestFloat.  Extracted only the add function which is easy/boring
and it looks good.  A NaN is not a fixed bit pattern so not surprising
they dont match.  I guess I could have said if this is a nan and that
is a nan then pass, instead I said if TestFloat says nan, continue;

This was derived directly from a cortex-m4 example, both support the
single precision instructions, didnt bother to change the function
names from m4xxxx.
